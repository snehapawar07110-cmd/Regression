Logistic Regression 

Logistic Regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms,
Which comes under the Supervised Learning Technique

It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a give set of independent variable.


1)BINOMIAL ; In binomial logistic regression ,there are only two possible types of the dependent variable ,such as 0 or 1,pass or fail ect.
